**Traffic-Alpha** is an innovative group that focuses on using machine learning algorithms to solve transportation problems. The project aims to improve traffic flow and increase mobility, making transportation more efficient and convenient. 

**Traffic-Alpha** is currently working on several projects that include signal signal control (TSC) and vehicle to everything (V2X). Through the use of artificial intelligence, Traffic-Alpha hopes to minimize traffic jams and reduce accidents, making travel safer and more hassle-free.


Our group is focused on building sustainable and affordable transportation systems that make use of advanced technologies to meet the needs of modern society. The project aims to provide effective solutions to transportation problems, ensuring that cities are better connected and more efficient for all.
